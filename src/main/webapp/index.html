        <h2>Welcome to my corner of the digital realm!</h2>
        <p>
            Hello, I'm Liam Csiffary, a University of Toronto student immersed in the worlds of Computer Science and Physics. From a childhood passion for dismantling toys to discovering the intricacies of old computers I have excitedly expanded into the realm coding as well.
            <br><br>
            With a foundation in languages like Python, C++, Java, and Swift, I've crafted diverse projects, including a comprehensive triangle program and a captivating roguelike RPG game. Collaborating with my brother in C# Unity, we've explored the synergy of our coding skills in game development.
            <br><br>
            With nine years of coding experience, I find joy in problem-solving and continuous learning. Join me as I navigate the ever-evolving landscape of technology, sharing experiences, projects, and the excitement that fuels my passion for computer science.

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            (See About Me page above for a more detailed rendition)<br><br>
            Hello! I'm Liam Csiffary, a current undergraduate student at the University of Toronto. I'm double majoring in Computer Science and Physics, with a minor in Mathematics. My interest in technology began early - tinkering with toys and exploring broken computers at scout camp.
            <br><br>
            I got hands-on experience with a Raspberry Pi, sparking my curiosity in coding. Starting with JavaScript on Khan Academy, I moved on to Python using VSCode. Exploring C++ showed me the speed advantage in programming.
            <br><br>
            In school, I delved into Java and Swift, focusing on Object-Oriented Programming. In high school, I went beyond Unity tutorials, creating a roguelike RPG game from scratch, earning praise for its complexity.
            <br><br>
            Venturing into C# Unity, I expanded my coding skills. Collaborating with my brother, we worked on joint game development projects, adding more diversity to my skill set.
            <br><br>
            Nine years into coding, I still enjoy problem-solving and learning new things. I look forward to the challenges ahead in the ever-evolving field of computer science.

        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <p>
            <h4><a href="https://github.com/TheWeeWum/UniVerse">UniVerse (Java, UofT Mapping Software Upgrade):</a></h4>
            Actively involved in a group project, UniVerse, as part of a computer science course at the University of Toronto. Our mission is to revamp the existing UofT map software. The enhanced program boasts increased speed, expanded functionality, and a visually appealing interface. UniVerse facilitates seamless navigation for students, allowing them to locate buildings using names or codes and obtain directions through Google Maps. Beyond navigation, the program incorporates a social dimension, enabling students to sign up, leave reviews on buildings or specific rooms, and curate a list of their favorite places. This project represents my commitment to addressing real-world challenges through innovative solutions, combining technical expertise with a user-centric approach.
                <br>
            <h4><a href="https://github.com/TheWeeWum/codesforintship/tree/main/fields">Fields: Gravitational/Electrical Field Lines:</a></h4>
            Designed and implemented a program to visualize gravitational, electrical, and magnetic fields of point charges on a 2D plane. The program features multithreading for optimized line drawing, a gradient representation to visualize field strength, and identification of Lagrange points. Practical applications include insights into the orbits, such as the James Webb Space Telescope's orbit around a Lagrange point. The program serves as a visual aid for better understanding physics concepts learned in coursework.
                <br>
            <h4><a href="https://github.com/TheWeeWum/codesforintship/tree/main/Chess">Chess Program:</a></h4>
            Developed a chess program, allowing users to explore valid moves, move pieces around the board, capture opponents' pieces, and eventually win by checkmating the king. Future goals include creating an advanced chess algorithm capable of self-competition and eventually training a neural network to beat the algorithm.
