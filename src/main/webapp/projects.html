            <h4><a href="https://github.com/TheWeeWum/UniVerse">UniVerse (Java, UofT Mapping Software Upgrade):</a></h4>
            <h2><a href="universe/index">see webpage</a></h2>
            Actively involved in a group project, UniVerse, as part of a computer science course at the University of Toronto. Our mission is to revamp the existing UofT map software. The enhanced program boasts increased speed, expanded functionality, and a visually appealing interface. UniVerse facilitates seamless navigation for students, allowing them to locate buildings using names or codes and obtain directions through Google Maps. Beyond navigation, the program incorporates a social dimension, enabling students to sign up, leave reviews on buildings or specific rooms, and curate a list of their favorite places. This project represents my commitment to addressing real-world challenges through innovative solutions, combining technical expertise with a user-centric approach.

            <h4><a href="https://github.com/TheWeeWum/codesforintship/tree/main/fields">Fields: Gravitational/Electrical Field Lines:</a></h4>
            Designed and implemented a program to visualize gravitational, electrical, and magnetic fields of point charges on a 2D plane. The program features multithreading for optimized line drawing, a gradient representation to visualize field strength, and identification of Lagrange points. Practical applications include insights into the orbits, such as the James Webb Space Telescope's orbit around a Lagrange point. The program serves as a visual aid for better understanding physics concepts learned in coursework.
                <br>
            <h4><a href="https://github.com/TheWeeWum/codesforintship/tree/main/Chess">Chess Program:</a></h4>
            Developed a chess program, allowing users to explore valid moves, move pieces around the board, capture opponents' pieces, and eventually win by checkmating the king. Future goals include creating an advanced chess algorithm capable of self-competition and eventually training a neural network to beat the algorithm.
                <br>
            <h4><a href="https://github.com/TheWeeWum/codesforintship/tree/main/stockProgram">Python Stock Analyst (Machine Learning Optimization):</a></h4>
            Developed a Python Stock Analyst tool utilizing machine learning techniques to optimize a set of parameters for maximizing gains in the stock market. While the program achieved performance exceeding the market's natural growth rate, its primary focus was to explore and experiment with cutting-edge machine learning methodologies. This for-fun project reflects my curiosity and willingness to explore new technologies in the ever-evolving field of finance and machine learning.
                <br>
            <h4>Roguelike RPG Game (Unity):</h4>
            In my final year of high school, I took on the challenge of creating a Unity game from scratch. Departing from a tutorial-based approach, I developed a roguelike RPG game with procedurally generated terrain, randomized enemies, and an upgradable player moveset. The project received acclaim from my Computer Science teacher for its innovation and complexity, showcasing my ability to learn, experiment, and deliver within tight timelines.
                <br>
            <h4><a href="https://github.com/TheWeeWum/codesforintship/tree/main/triangle">Comprehensive Triangle Program (Java):</a></h4>
                As part of my exploration into the realm of Object-Oriented Programming, I crafted a comprehensive triangle program in Java. This program calculates a myriad of properties related to triangles, showcasing my proficiency in algorithmic problem-solving and attention to detail. The experience enhanced my skills in Java and deepened my understanding of mathematical concepts applied in programming.
                <br>
            <h4><a href="https://github.com/TheWeeWum/codesforintship/tree/main/pythonTextGame">Python Text-Based RPG (OOP Skills Exploration):</a></h4>
            Created a Python Text-Based RPG game during high school summer, aiming to test and enhance basic Object-Oriented Programming skills. The game featured an inventory system, an equipment system, and engaging mechanics where players could equip items dropped by defeated monsters. The inclusion of health, mana, and leveling systems added depth to the gaming experience. In an attempt to elevate the visual experience, I successfully ported the game to Python's Pygame system, demonstrating adaptability and a willingness to explore new technologies.
