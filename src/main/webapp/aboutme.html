        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Greetings! I'm Liam Csiffary, a passionate undergraduate student
            at the University of Toronto, delving into the realms of mathematical
            and physical sciences. Currently pursuing a double major in
            Computer Science and Physics, with a minor in Mathematics, my academic
            journey is fueled by a profound fascination for the intricate world of
            Computer Science and mathematics.
            <br><br>
            My journey into the realm of technology began with an insatiable
            curiosity for understanding how things work. Even before encountering
            computers or programming, I found joy in dismantling toys and experimenting
            with anything within reach, transforming them into imaginative creations.
            My introduction to computers occurred during a small camp with my scouts
            group, where the allure of disassembling and exploring the inner workings
            of old computers sparked my interest.
            <br><br>
            A pivotal moment came when my dad introduced me to the world of Raspberry Pi.
            This small but powerful device became the canvas for my experimentation
            with software, paving the way for my initial foray into coding. Starting
            with JavaScript on Khan Academy, I progressed through their courses before
            venturing into independent programming using VSCode to explore the
            intricacies of Python.
            <br><br>
            The journey continued as I delved into the realm of C++, discovering
            the exhilarating speed at which programs could run. Motivated by the
            desire for optimization, I revisited and enhanced projects initially
            crafted in Python. My formal education introduced me to Java and Swift,
            and I dedicated substantial time honing my skills in Object-Oriented
            Programming, culminating in the creation of a comprehensive triangle
            program which calculated just about every possible thing you could
            calculate about a triangle.
            <br><br>
            In my final year of high school we were to create
            a Unity game based off of one of the Unity tutorials. However, I felt that I
            would learn more starting from scratch, as I had been doing my whole life
            up until that point. And so after much research, debugging, and experimenting
            I created a pretty cool roguelike RPG game with procedurally generating terrain,
            randomized enemies, and an upgradable moveset for the player.
            My Computer Science teacher was blown away by my creation telling me how
            impressive it was especially considering how little time we had to develop it.
            <br><br>
            The journey continued into the realm of C# Unity, where I expanded my
            repertoire of coding languages. Collaborating with my brother, we
            embarked on joint ventures in game development, combining our skills to
            create engaging projects. The synergy of our efforts further fueled my passion
            for problem-solving and continuous learning.
            <br><br>
            Today, with nine years of coding experience under my belt, I find myself
            still enthralled by the dynamic landscape of computer science. I revel in
            the joy of solving problems, pushing boundaries, and embarking on the next
            challenge. As I continue my academic journey, I am excited about the endless
            possibilities that await in the ever-evolving world of technology.
